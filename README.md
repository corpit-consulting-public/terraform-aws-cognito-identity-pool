# tf-aws-cognito-identity-pool

Terraform module that creates Cognito User Pool resources in AWS

  Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your account.
## Usage

```hcl

module "cognito-identity-pool" {
  source                           = "./modules/tf-aws-cognito-identity-pool"
  identity_pool_name               = "${var.identity_pool_name}"
  allow_unauthenticated_identities = "${var.allow_unauthenticated_identities}"
  client_id                        = "${module.cognito-user-pool.id}"
  provider_name                    = "${var.provider_name}"
  server_side_token_check          = "${var.server_side_token_check}"
}

```
